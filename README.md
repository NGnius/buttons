Custom widgets for simple tasks.

Adapted from a template for using [decky-frontend-lib](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-frontend-lib) in a [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader) plugin.

## Developers

### Dependencies

This project relies on `npm` and `rustup`.
For building on another Linux PC, Rust toolchain `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` must also be installed.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to use as an example for making your plugin.
2. In your clone of the repository run these commands to build the front-end:
   1. ``npm install``
   2. ``npm run build``
3. From `backend/`, Run `./build.sh` to build the back-end.

### Distribution

IDK, maybe a bit of custom spins as well as a barebones offering from me
